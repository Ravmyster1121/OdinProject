# The Odin Project
The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. Since its inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless others in learning enough programming to work on their own personal projects. 

This is where I'm following along with the fundamentals  
My start date was Wednesday 12th February 2025.

## My Learning Goal
My goal is to improve my frontend development skills by completing a course going over the fundamentals all the way up to using the React framework. 
I then want to take the knowledge and apply it, by revamping the directory website for my personal web server portal.
